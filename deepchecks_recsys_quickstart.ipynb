    "===============================================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "Deepchecks Recommender  is your go-to tool for developing and evaluating recommender system models, ensuring their robustness before deployment. Our comprehensive testing package not only detects potential failures but also saves you valuable development time. In this quickstart guide, you'll learn how to utilize Deepchecks Recommender to analyze and evaluate various aspects of your recommender system, including data quality, leakage, product associations, cold start detection, and drift. Let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Data Preparation and Auto Analysis**\n",
    "---------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "To run Deepchecks Recommender, make sure you have the following data for both your training and testing sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User-Item Interaction Data: A structured dataset containing information about user-item interactions. Each record represents a user's interaction with an item, such as viewing, purchasing, or rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Product Information: Additional information about the items in your catalog, like product categories, descriptions, or features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. User Information (Optional): If available, user-specific data such as demographics, preferences, or historical behavior can enhance the evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Your labels : These are not needed for checks that don't require labels (such as the Cold Start Detection check or most data integrity checks), but are needed for many other checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Your model's predictions: These are needed only for the model related checks, shown in the Model Evaluation section of this guide."
