Examples

Open from Docs - *Recommended*
==============================

All examples can be viewed in the 
`Examples <https://docs.deepchecks.com/en/stable/examples/index.html?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=examples_folder>`__
section in the documentation.

Note that they can be also be launched directly from the documentation,
using google colab or binder,
by clicking on the badges that each notebook has on the top right side:

.. raw:: html

   <p align="center">
      <a href="https://docs.deepchecks.com/en/stable/examples/index.html?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=examples_folder_image">
      <img src="/docs/images/notebook-example-launch-badges.png">
      </a>
   </p>

Download from Git
===================

Notice that viewing the notebooks within git **will not parse the graph outputs**.
Having said that, if you still want to access the raw examples notebooks directly, you can head to the
`examples folder </docs/source/examples>`__. 

.. note::

	In order to see the graphs when running a notebook locally, you need to define it as `Trusted <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44943646/jupyter-notebook-not-trusted>`__.
