Deepchecks ❤️ Open Source
========================

This package is built and maintained by `Deepchecks <https://deepchecks.com/>`__, an MLOps startup company. We're a team of data 
scientists and software engineers that recognize the rising influence of machine learning models on our day-to-day life, and 
want to make sure these models are working as they expected to.

We've built and released this package to help ML fellows test and validate their models and catch issues in their models as early as possible, so
all of us can keep enjoying the benefits of ML algorithms.

In the recent years, the MLOps community is getting bigger focus from many stakeholders: startup companies trying to shift
their product to the mlops space, new startups that are trying to solve challenging problems, and VCs invest in those. The competition in 
the field is rising and challenging.

**We believe that competition should stay out of the open source community.**

Unfortunately, some companies take adventage of the OSS community. They have targeted community members that starred this 
repository and sent cold emails trying to convince them that "open source tools will never deliver scalability", and that they should 
try their enterprise paid product. They have found minor flaws in our package, and instead of contributing back to the community, they
took adventage of it. 

This action tried to exploits the foundations of the open source community, the same community that keeps changing the tech world.
Products and tools like the Linux OS, Kubernetes, Tensorflow, PyTorch, React.js, and many more life-changing tools are trully open source
and driven by the OSS community. 

We should all be strongly against any action that tries to harm our community.
