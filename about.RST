===========================
Deepchecks ‚ù§Ô∏è Open Source
===========================

This package is built and maintained by `Deepchecks <https://deepchecks.com/>`__, an MLOps startup company. We're a team of data 
scientists and software engineers that recognize the rising influence of machine learning models on our day-to-day life, and 
want to make sure these models are working as they are expected to.

**We've built and released this package to help ML fellows test and validate their models and catch issues in their models as early as possible, so
all of us can keep enjoying the benefits of ML algorithms.**

In the recent years, the MLOps community is getting more focus from many stakeholders: Startup companies trying to shift
their product to the mlops space, new startups that are trying to solve challenging problems, and VCs investing in them. The competition in 
the field is rising and challenging.

**We believe that open source communities should be about value for the users and not an arena for battles between competitors.**

We believe that open source is the natural and healthy way into the hearts of ML practitioners. It is also a healthy way to learn about their preferences and
benefit from their contributions and suggestions. We will welcome any worthy contribution or comment, even if it comes from a competitors, since we believe our users should come first.

Our preferred way for feedback is:

- `Opening a Github issue <https://www.github.com/deepchecks/deepchecks/issues>`__

- `Posting in our community slack <https://join.slack.com/t/deepcheckscommunity/shared_invite/zt-18t2fxw7a-16zag~Y9hZI_wvQYh2Jccg>`__


Short Update About Our Community and Ethics:
------------------------------------------------

We have recently encountered also  `a more unusual method üëÄ <https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6930518775905550336/>`_ for delivering feedback, which we hope won't happen again.

We believe that respect is key to help open source communities evolve and to keep changing the tech world.
Products and tools like the Linux OS, Kubernetes, Tensorflow, PyTorch, React.js, and many more life-changing tools are truly open source
and are driven by the OSS community. We should all be strongly against any action that undermine the values that are customary for open source communities.
