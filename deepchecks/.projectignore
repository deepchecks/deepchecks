# This file contains a list of match patterns that instructs
# anaconda-project to exclude certain files or directories when
# building a project archive. The file format is a simplfied
# version of Git's .gitignore file format. In fact, if the
# project is hosted in a Git repository, these patterns can be
# merged into the .gitignore file and this file removed.
# See the anaconda-project documentation for more details.
