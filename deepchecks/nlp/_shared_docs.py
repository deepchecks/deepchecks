        Notes
        -----
        The accepted formats for providing model predictions and probabilities are detailed below

        **Text Classification**

        *Single Class Predictions*

        - predictions - A sequence of class names or indices with one entry per sample, matching the set of classes
          present in the labels.
        - probabilities - A sequence of sequences with each element containing the vector of class probabilities for
          each sample. Each such vector should have one probability per class according to the class (sorted) order, and
          the probabilities should sum to 1 for each sample.

        *Multilabel Predictions*

        - predictions - A sequence of sequences with each element containing a binary vector denoting the presence of
          the i-th class for the given sample. Each such vector should have one binary indicator per class according to
          the class (sorted) order. More than one class can be present for each sample.
        - probabilities - A sequence of sequences with each element containing the vector of class probabilities for
          each sample. Each such vector should have one probability per class according to the class (sorted) order, and
          the probabilities should range from 0 to 1 for each sample, but are not required to sum to 1.

        **Token Classification**

        - predictions - A sequence of sequences, with the inner sequence containing tuples in the following
          format: (class_name, span_start, span_end, class_probability). span_start and span_end are the start and end
          character indices  of the token within the text, as it was passed to the raw_text argument. Each upper level
          sequence contains a sequence of tokens for each sample.
        - probabilities - No probabilities should be passed for Token Classification tasks. Passing probabilities will
          result in an error.

        Examples
        --------

        **Text Classification**

        *Single Class Predictions*

        >>> predictions = ['class_1', 'class_1', 'class_2']
        >>> probabilities = [[0.2, 0.8], [0.5, 0.5], [0.3, 0.7]]

        *Multilabel Predictions*

        >>> predictions = [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1]]
        >>> probabilities = [[0.2, 0.3, 0.8], [0.4, 0.9, 0.6]]

        **Token Classification**

        >>> predictions = [[('class_1', 0, 2, 0.8), ('class_2', 7, 10, 0.9)], [('class_2', 42, 54, 0.4)], []]
