    Return the difference in PPS (Predictive Power Score) of all features between train and test datasets.

    The PPS represents the ability of a feature to single-handedly predict another feature or label.
    A high PPS (close to 1) can mean that this feature's success in predicting the label is actually due to data
    leakage - meaning that the feature holds information that is based on the label to begin with.

    When we compare train PPS to test PPS, A high difference can strongly indicate leakage,
    as a feature that was "powerful" in train but not in test can be explained by leakage in train that does
    not affect a new dataset.

    Uses the ppscore package - for more info, see https://github.com/8080labs/ppscore
