The math in examples require `dvisvgm` and `latex` installed. On Ubuntu
you can install these within

`apt install texlive-latex dvisvgm`

For Windows and Mac OS you will need to install Texlive/Miktex from tex.org org
Miktex's website.

The two commands must be in `PATH` for math examples to work.
