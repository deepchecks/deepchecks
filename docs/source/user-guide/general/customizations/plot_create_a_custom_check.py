=====================
Create a Custom Check
=====================

It is possible to extend deepchecks by implementing custom checks. This
enables you to have your own logic of metrics or validation, or even just
to display your own graph using deepchecks' suite.

While some aspects for writing a check are similar when writing checks for the
``deepchecks.tabular`` ``and deepchecks.vision`` subpackages, there are major differences
that warrant a separate guide for each:

- :doc:`Tabular Custom Check Guide. </user-guide/tabular/tutorials/plot_add_a_custom_check>`__
- :doc:`Vision Custom Check Guide. </user-guide/vision/tutorials/plot_custom_checks>`__
