NLP Quickstarts
===============

Deepchecks for NLP is currently in alpha stage. The following quickstart will walk you through how you can try the
existing functionality quickly for your own NLP project.

In addition to the individual quickstarts available here, you can also use built-in
:ref:`Suites <deepchecks_hierarchy_suite>` to run all the checks relevant to a specific part in your ML pipeline.
For the API reference of each of the built-in Suites, check out :mod:`deepchecks.nlp.suites`.

This is an alpha release and you can help us develop it further! You can provide feedback and suggestions as issues on
`GitHub <https://github.com/deepchecks/deepchecks/issues>`__, or by joining our
`Community Slack <https://join.slack.com/t/deepcheckscommunity/shared_invite/zt-18t2fxw7a-16zag~Y9hZI_wvQYh2Jccg>`_.
