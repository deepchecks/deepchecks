Test Your Vision Data Class During Development
================================================

"Data Classes" are used to transform the structure of your data to the
structure required for deepchecks. To help ensure they work
as intended, deepchecks has built-in helper functions for
validating their structure. This guide will demonstrate how to use this helper function
to implement them for your own data, step by step.


**Structure:**

* `Load data and model <#load-data-and-model>`__
* `Create simple DetectionData object <#create-simple-detectiondata-object>`__
* `Running the extractors validation <#running-the-extractors-validation>`__
* `Understand validation results <#understand-validation-results>`__
* `The end result <#the-end-result>`__

#%%
# Load data and model
# -------------------
# In the first step we load the DataLoader and our model

from deepchecks.vision.datasets.detection.coco import load_dataset, load_model

data_loader = load_dataset(train=False, batch_size=1000, object_type='DataLoader')
model = load_model()

#%%
# Create simple DetectionData object
# ----------------------------------
# In the second step since this is an object detection task we will override a
# DetectionData object with simple extracting functions. We know our DataLoader
# and model's output are not in the format expected by deepchecks, so when we
# validate them on our data we will see in the results the functions we overrided
# are not passing, and then we will implement a correct functions.

from deepchecks.vision.detection_data import DetectionData


class CocoDetectionData(DetectionData):
    def batch_to_images(self, batch):
        return batch[0]

    def batch_to_labels(self, batch):
        return batch[1]

    def infer_on_batch(self, batch, model, device):
        return model.to(device)(batch[0])

#%%
# Running the extractors validation
# ---------------------------------
# Now we will load our validate function and see the results while running
# the extractors on our data. The function will print for us the validation
# results. At the end, if all your extractors are valid the output should look
# in `this <#The-end-result>`__.

from deepchecks.vision.utils.validation import validate_extractors

validate_extractors(CocoDetectionData(data_loader), model)

#%%
# Understand validation results
# -----------------------------
# When looking at the result first thing we see is that it's separated into 2 parts.
#
# First one is about the structure we expect to get. This validation is automatic
# since it's purely technical and doesn't check content correctness. For example,
# in our validation above we see that the label extractor is passing, meaning the
# labels are returning in the expected format. Second part is about the content,
# which can't be automatically validated and requires your attention. This part
# includes looking visually at data outputted by the formatters to validate it is
# right. In the validation above we see a list of classes that doesn't seem to make
# sense. This is because although our labels are in the right structure, the content
# inside is not valid.
#
# We know that the classes in our data are represented by class id which is an int,
# therefore we understand the labels does not contain the data in the right order.
# For the next step we'll fix the label extractor and then validate again:
