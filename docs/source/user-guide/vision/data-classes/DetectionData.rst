===============================
The Object Detection Data Class
===============================

The DetectionData is a :doc:`data class </user-guide/vision/data-classes/index>` designed for object detection tasks.
It is a subclass of the :class:`~deepchecks.vision.VisionData` class and is used to help deepchecks load and interact with object detection data using a well defined format.
detection related checks.

For more info, please visit the API reference page: :class:`~deepchecks.vision.DetectionData`

Accepted Image Format
---------------------

All checks in deepchecks require images in the same format. They use the :func:`~deepchecks.vision.VisionData.batch_to_images` function in order to get
the images in the correct format. For more info on the accepted formats, please visit the
:doc:`VisionData User Guide </user-guide/vision/data-classes/VisionData>`.

Accepted Label Format
---------------------

Deepchecks' checks use the :func:`~deepchecks.vision.DetectionData.batch_to_labels` function in order to get the labels in the correct format.
The accepted label format for is a a list of length N containing tensors of shape (B, 5), where N is the number
of samples within a batch, B is the number of bounding boxes in the sample and each bounding box is represented by 5 values:
``(class_id, x_min, y_min, w, h)``.

    x_min and y_min are the coordinates (in pixels) of the **top left corner** of the bounding box, w
    and h are the width and height of the bounding box (in pixels) and class_id is the class id of the prediction.

For example, for a sample with 2 bounding boxes, the label format may be:
``tensor([[1, 8.4, 50.2, 100, 100], [5, 26.4, 10.1, 20, 40]])``.

Accepted Prediction Format
--------------------------

Deepchecks' checks use the :func:`~deepchecks.vision.DetectionData.infer_on_batch` function in order to get the predictions of the model in the correct format.
The accepted prediction format is a list of length N containing tensors of shape (B, 6), where N is the number
of images, B is the number of bounding boxes detected in the sample and each bounding box is represented by 6
values: ``[x_min, y_min, w, h, confidence, class_id]``.

    x_min,y_min,w and h represent the bounding box location as above, confidence is the confidence score given by the model to
    bounding box and class_id is the class id predicted by the model.

For example, for a sample with 2 bounding boxes, the prediction format may be:
``tensor([[8.4, 50.2, 100, 100, 0.9, 1], [26.4, 10.1, 20, 40, 0.8, 5]])``.

Example
--------

Assuming we have implemented a torch DataLoader whose underlying __getitem__ method returns a tuple of the form:
``(images, bboxes)``. ``image`` is a tensor of shape (N, C, H, W) in which the images pixel values are normalized to
[0, 1] range based on the mean and std of the ImageNet dataset. ``bboxes`` is a tensor of shape (N, B, 5) in which
each box arrives in the format: ``(class_id, x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max)``. Additionally, we are using Yolo as a model.
