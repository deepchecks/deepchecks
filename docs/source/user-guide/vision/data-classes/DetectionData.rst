===============================
The Object Detection Data Class
===============================

The DetectionData is a :doc:`data class </user-guide/vision/data-classes/index>` represents a CV object detection task in deepchecks.
It is a subclass of the :class:`~deepchecks.vision.VisionData` class and is used to load and preprocess data for an
object detection task.
The DetectionData class contains additional data and general methods intended for easy access to relevant metadata
for object detection ML models validation.

For more info, please visit the API reference page: :class:`~deepchecks.vision.DetectionData`

Accepted Image Format
---------------------
All checks in deepchecks require images in the same format. They use the :func:`~deepchecks.vision.VisionData.batch_to_images` function in order to get
the images in the correct format. For more info on the accepted formats, please visit the
`VisionData User Guide <VisionData.rst>`_.

Accepted Label Format
---------------------
Deepchecks' checks use the :func:`~deepchecks.vision.DetectionData.batch_to_labels` function in order to get the labels in the correct format.
The accepted label format for is a a list of length N containing tensors of shape (B, 5), where N is the number
of samples, B is the number of bounding boxes in the sample and each bounding box is represented by 5 values:
``(class_id, x, y, w, h)``.

    x and y are the coordinates (in pixels) of the upper left corner of the bounding box, w
    and h are the width and height of the bounding box (in pixels) and class_id is the class id of the prediction.

For example, for a sample with 2 bounding boxes, the label format may be:
``[(1, 8.4, 50.2, 100, 100), (5, 26.4, 10.1, 20, 40)]``.

Accepted Prediction Format
--------------------------
Deepchecks' checks use the :func:`~deepchecks.vision.DetectionData.infer_on_batch` function in order to get the predictions of the model in the correct format.
The accepted prediction format is a list of length N containing tensors of shape (B, 6), where N is the number
of images, B is the number of bounding boxes detected in the sample and each bounding box is represented by 6
values: ``[x, y, w, h, confidence, class_id]``.

    x and y are the coordinates (in pixels) of the upper left corner
    of the bounding box, w and h are the width and height of the bounding box (in pixels), confidence is the
    confidence of the model and class_id is the class id.

For example, for a sample with 2 bounding boxes, the prediction format may be:
``[(8.4, 50.2, 100, 100, 0.9, 1), (26.4, 10.1, 20, 40, 0.8, 5)]``.
