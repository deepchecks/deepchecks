======================
Welcome to Deepchecks!
======================

Deepchecks is the leading tool for testing and for validating your machine learning models
and data, and it enables doing so with minimal effort. Deepchecks accompanies you through
various validation and testing needs such as verifying your data's integrity, inspecting its distributions,
validating data splits, evaluating your model and comparing between different models.


.. note::
    In addition to perusing the documentation, please feel free to
    to ask questions on our `Slack Community <https://join.slack.com/t/deepcheckscommunity/shared_invite/zt-y28sjt1v-PBT50S3uoyWui_Deg5L_jg>`_,
    or to post a issue or start a discussion on `Github <https://github.com/deepchecks/deepchecks/>`_.
