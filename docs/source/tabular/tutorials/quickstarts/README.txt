These are great as initial entry points to get familiar with the value you can get from deepchecks.
For more info about each of the recommended scenarios, check out the :ref:`when_should_you_use_deepchecks` guide.
For the API reference of each of the built-in Suites, check out :mod:`deepchecks.tabular.suites`.

Of course, every research process has its unique steps and challenges, and therefore all checks and suites can easily customized,
more info about customizations of suites, conditions, checks, etc. can be found in the :ref:`tabular__index`.
