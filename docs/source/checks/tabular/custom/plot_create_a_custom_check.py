=====================
Create a Custom Check
=====================

In addition to deepchecks' built-in checks, it is possible to extend deepchecks by implementing custom checks. This
enables you to have your own logic of metrics or validation, or even just to display your own graph using deepchecks'
suite.

For more information about writing custom tabular checks, please refer to the
:doc:`Tabular Custom Check Guide. </user-guide/tabular/auto_tutorials/plot_add_a_custom_check>`
