=====================
Create a Custom Check
=====================

In addition to deepchecks' built-in checks, it is possible to extend deepchecks by implementing custom checks. This
enables you to have your own logic of metrics or validation, or even just to display your own graph using deepchecks'
suite.

For more information about writing custom vision checks, please refer to the
:doc:`Vision Custom Check Guide. </user-guide/vision/auto_tutorials/plot_custom_checks>`
