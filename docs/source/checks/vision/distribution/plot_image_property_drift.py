How Does the ImagePropertyDrift Check Work?
=================================
Data drift is simply a change in the distribution of data over time. It is also one
of the top reasons that a machine learning model performance degrades over time.

In the context of machine learning, drift between the training set and the test set
will likely make the model prone to errors. In other words, if the model was trained
on data that is different from the current test data, it will probably make more mistakes
predicting the target variable.

The Image Property Drift check calculates a drift score for each image property in
the test dataset, by comparing its distribution to the train dataset. For this, we
use the Earth Movers Distance (Wasserstein distance).

Which Image Properties Are Used?
=================================
==============================  ==========
Property name                   What is it
==============================  ==========
Aspect Ratio                    Ratio between height and width of image (height / width)
Area                            Area of image in pixels (height * width)
Brightness                      Average intensity of image pixels. Color channels have different weights according to
                                RGB-to-Grayscale formula
RMS Contrast                    Contrast of image, calculated by standard deviation of pixels
Mean Red Relative Intensity     Mean over all pixels of the red channel, scaled to their relative intensity in
                                comparison to the other channels [r / (r + g + b)].
Mean Green Relative Intensity   Mean over all pixels of the green channel, scaled to their relative intensity in
                                comparison to the other channels [g / (r + g + b)].
Mean Blue Relative Intensity    Mean over all pixels of the blue channel, scaled to their relative intensity in
                                comparison to the other channels [b / (r + g + b)].

# Check Parameters
# ----------------
# Image Property Drift Check accepts two parameters that allows us to control the look of the output:
#
# * `image_properties` - list of image properties that we are interested in
# * `max_num_categories` - Maximal number of categories to use for the calculation of drift using PSI (Population Stability Index)
#
# Only next string values are allowed for the `image_properties` parameter:
#
# * `aspect_ratio`
# * `area`
# * `brightness`
# * `mean_red_relative_intensity`
# * `mean_green_relative_intensity`
# * `mean_blue_relative_intensity`
