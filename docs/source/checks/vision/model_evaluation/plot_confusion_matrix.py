Confusion Matrix
****************

This notebooks provides an overview for using and understanding the confusion matrix check.

* `Generate Dataset <#generate-dataset>`__
* `Run the check <#run-the-check>`__

What is the purpose of the check? 
=================================
The confusion matrix check outputs a confusion matrix for both classification problems
and object detection problems. In object detection problems, some predictions do not
overlap on any label and can be classified as not found in the confusion matrix.

#%%
# Generate Dataset
# ----------------
# We generate a sample dataset of 128 images from the `COCO dataset <https://cocodataset.org/#home>`__,
# and using the `YOLOv5 model <https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5>`__.
#
# .. note::
#   In this example, we use the pytorch version of the coco dataset and model. In order to run this example using
#   tensorflow, please change the import statements to::
#
#       from deepchecks.vision.datasets.detection import coco_tensorflow as coco

from deepchecks.vision.datasets.detection import coco_torch as coco

train_ds = coco.load_dataset(object_type='VisionData')

#%%
# Run the check
# -------------

from deepchecks.vision.checks import ConfusionMatrixReport

check = ConfusionMatrixReport(categories_to_display=10)
result = check.run(train_ds)
result

#%%
# To display the results in an IDE like PyCharm, you can use the following code:

#  result.show_in_window()
#%%
# The result will be displayed in a new window.
