Train Test Label Drift
**********************

This notebooks provides an overview for using and understanding label drift check.

* `Run check on an Object Detection task <#run-the-check-on-an-object-detection-task-coco>`__

What Is Label Drift?
========================
Drift is simply a change in the distribution of data over time, and it is
also one of the top reasons why machine learning model's performance degrades
over time.

Label drift is when drift occurs in the label itself.

For more information on drift, please visit our :doc:`drift guide </user-guide/general/drift_guide>`.

How Deepchecks Detects Label Drift
------------------------------------

This check detects label drift by using :ref:`univariate measures <drift_detection_by_univariate_measure>`
on the label properties.

Using Label Properties to Detect Label Drift
--------------------------------------------
In computer vision specifically, our labels may be complex, and measuring their drift
is not a straightforward task. Therefore, we calculate drift on different :doc:`properties of the label</user-guide/vision/vision_properties>`,
on which we can directly measure drift.

Which Label Properties Are Used?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
================  ===================================  ==========
Task Type         Property name                        What is it
================  ===================================  ==========
Classification    Samples Per Class                    Number of images per class
Object Detection  Samples Per Class                    Number of bounding boxes per class
Object Detection  Bounding Box Area                    Area of bounding box (height * width)
Object Detection  Number of Bounding Boxes Per Image   Number of bounding box objects in each image
================  ===================================  ==========

# Understanding the results

# We can see there is almost no drift between the train & test labels. This means the
# split to train and test was good (as it is balanced and random). Let's check the
# performance of a simple model trained on MNIST.

# MNIST with label drift
# ======================
# Now, let's try to separate the MNIST dataset in a different manner that will result
# in a label drift, and see how it affects the performance. We are going to create a
# custom `collate_fn`` in the test dataset, that will select samples with class 0 in
# a 1/10 chances.

# Results
# -------
# We can see the check successfully detects the (expected) drift in class 0

# Inferring the results
# ---------------------

#%%
# Label drift is detected!
# ------------------------
# We can see that the COCO128 contains a drift in the out of the box dataset. In
# addition to the label count per class, the label drift check for object detection
# tasks include drift calculation on certain measurements, like the bounding box
# area and the number of bboxes per image.
