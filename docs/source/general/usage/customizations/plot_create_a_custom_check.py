Create a Custom Check
=====================

It is possible to extend deepchecks by implementing custom checks. This
enables you to have your own logic of metrics or validation, or even just
to display your own graph using deepchecks' suite.

For implementing custom checks, please refer to:

- :ref:`Tabular Custom Check Guide <tabular__create_custom_check>`
- :ref:`Vision Custom Check Guide <vision__custom_check>`
