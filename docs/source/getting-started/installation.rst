Installation
============

Deepchecks requires Python 3 and can be installed using pip or conda, depending on the package manager
that you're working with for most of your packages.

As a best practice we recommend working on `a virtual environment`_ for pip
and with `a conda environment`_ for conda.

Deepchecks For Tabular Data
============================


Local Installation With Pip
-----------------------------

The deepchecks package can be installed from `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/deepchecks/>`__ using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install deepchecks --upgrade

.. note::
    Deepchecks is in active development, which means that new versions are released on a weekly basis and new features are frequently added.
    If you experience any unexpected behavior from deepchecks, the first step to troubleshoot is to upgrade to the latest version.


Local Installation With Conda
--------------------------------

To install the deepchecks package from the conda package manager run

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge deepchecks

or, if you already have deepchecks installed and want to update then run

.. code-block:: bash

    conda update -c conda-forge deepchecks


Installing Within a Jupyter Notebook
--------------------------------------

Simply run the following command in a notebook cell

.. code-block:: bash

    import sys
    !{sys.executable} -m pip install deepchecks --quiet --upgrade # --user


Deepchecks For NLP
==================

.. note:: 
   Deepchecks' NLP subpackage is in **beta** release, and is available from PyPI,
   use at your own discretion. `Github Issues <https://github.com/deepchecks/deepchecks/issues>`__ are
   highly encouraged for feature requests and bug reports.

Installation of deepchecks for NLP should be stated explicitly and it includes
both the installation of the tabular version and of the nlp subpackage.
Example commands from above should be altered to install `deepchecks[nlp]`.


Using Pip
---------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install "deepchecks[nlp]" --upgrade


Deepchecks For Computer Vision
===============================

.. note::
   Deepchecks' Computer Vision subpackage is in **beta** release, and is available from PyPI,
   use at your own discretion. `Github Issues <https://github.com/deepchecks/deepchecks/issues>`__ are
   highly encouraged for feature requests and bug reports.

Installation of deepchecks for CV should be stated explicitly and it includes
both the installation of the tabular version and of the computer vision subpackage.
Example commands from above should be altered to install `deepchecks[vision]`.


Using Pip
---------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install "deepchecks[vision]" --upgrade

Start Working with the Package
=================================

Now it's time to :doc:`check out </general/index>` deepchecks!


Latest Version Check
--------------------
We are improving and updating our package constantly, so it's important to work on the latest version whenever possible.
Because of that, the package checks by default if it is the latest version. If not, a warning is printed.

As a side benefit, the latest version check helps us estimate how many people are using the package.
We want to keep building and improving deepchecks, so this metric is important to us. The check is performed
only once, on the first import of the package in the python context.

No credentials, data, personal information or anything private is collected, and will never be.

By default, the latest version check is turned on. You can opt-out at any time by setting the
``DISABLE_LATEST_VERSION_CHECK`` environment variable to ``True``.

.. code-block:: bash

    export DISABLE_LATEST_VERSION_CHECK=True
