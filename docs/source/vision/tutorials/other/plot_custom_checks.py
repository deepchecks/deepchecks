Creating a Custom Check
=======================

Deepchecks offers a wide range of checks for computer vision problems, addressing distribution issues, performance
checks and more. Nevertheless, in order to fully validate your ML pipeline you often need to write your own checks.
This guide will walk you through the basics of writing your own checks.

We recommend writing a single check for each aspect of the model or data you would like to validate. As explained in
:ref:`general__deepchecks_hierarchy`, the role of the check is to run the logic and output a display and
a pythonic value. Then, a condition can be defined on that value to determine if the check is successful or not.

Vision Checks Structure
========================

The first step when writing a vision check is to decide what check base class to use. You can read more in the
`Base Checks Types <#base-checks-types>`__ section. In this case, we wish to compare train and test dataset, so we select the
:class:`deepchecks.core.checks.TrainTestBaseCheck`. This type of check must implement the following three methods:

- initialize_run - Actions to be performed before starting to iterate over the dataloader batches.
- update - Actions to be performed on each batch.
- compute - Actions to be performed after iterating over all the batches. Returns the check display and the return
  value.

While `ModelOnlyCheck` alone do not implement the update method. Apart from that, the check init should recipient and
handle check parameters.


Write a Basic Check
========================

Let's implement a simple check, comparing the average of each color channel between the train and the test dataset.

We'll start by writing the simplest possible example, returning only a dict of the color averages. We'll use external
functions when implementing the check in order to be able to reuse them later.

**Good to know: the return value of a check can be any object, a number, dictionary, string, etc…**

The Context and Batch Objects
-----------------------------
The three methods of the vision check - initialize_run, update and compute, make use of the Context object and the Batch
object.

The context object contains the basic objects deepchecks uses - the train and test
`VisionData </user-guide/vision/VisionData>`__ objects, and the use model itself.
The Batch objects contains processed data from the dataloader, such as the images, labels and model predictions.
For some checks, such as the one shown in this example, the Context object is not needed.

For more examples of using the Context and Batch objects for different types of base checks, see the
:ref:`vision__custom_check_templates` guide.

# Our check ran successfully, but we got the print “Nothing found”. This is because we haven’t defined to the check
# anything to display, so the default behavior is to print “Nothing found”. In order to access the value that we have

# Check Display
# ========================
#
# Most of the times we will want our checks to have a visual display that will quickly summarize the check result. We
# can pass objects for display to the CheckResult. Objects for display should be of type: html string, dataframe or a
# function that plots a graph. Let’s define a graph that will be displayed using `Plotly <https://plotly.com/>`_. We
# will inherit from the original check to shorten the code an update only the compute method.
#
# **Good to know: ``display`` can receive a single object to display or a list of objects**

# Base Checks Types
# ==================
# Vision checks all inherit from one of the following classes:
#
# - :class:`~deepchecks.vision.base_checks.SingleDatasetCheck` - Check that runs on a single dataset and model.
# - :class:`~deepchecks.vision.base_checks.TrainTestCheck` - Check that runs on a train and test dataset and model.
# - :class:`~deepchecks.vision.base_checks.ModelOnlyCheck` - Check that runs on only a model .
#
# All three classes inherit from the :class:`~deepchecks.core.checks.BaseCheck` BaseCheck, same as checks in any other
# deepchecks subpackage. Each has its own run signature, according to the objects on which it will run.
#
# The first two classes of checks run some logic on the image data, and so the check structure is designed to enable
# accumulating and computation on batches outputted by the dataloader.
