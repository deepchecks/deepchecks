Multi Label Classification Quickstart
*************************************

Deepchecks NLP tests your models during model development/research and before deploying to production. Using our
testing package reduces model failures and saves tests development time. In this quickstart guide, you will learn how
to use the deepchecks NLP package to analyze and evaluate a text
multi label classification task. If you are interested in a regular multiclass classification task, you can
refer to our :ref:`Multiclass Quickstart <nlp__multiclass_quickstart>`. We will cover the following:

1. `Creating a TextData object and auto calculating properties <#setting-up>`__
2. `Running the built-in suites <#running-the-deepchecks-default-suites>`__
3. `Running individual checks <#running-individual-checks>`__

To run deepchecks for NLP, you need the following for both your train and test data:

1. Your text data - a list of strings, each string is a single sample (can be a sentence, paragraph, document, etc.).
2. Your labels and prediction in the :ref:`correct format <nlp__supported_text_classification>` (Optional).
3. :ref:`Metadata <nlp__metadata_guide>`, :ref:`Properties <nlp__properties_guide>`
   or :ref:`Embeddings <nlp__embeddings_guide>` for the provided text data (Optional).

If you don't have deepchecks installed yet:

.. code:: python

    import sys
    !{sys.executable} -m pip install 'deepchecks[nlp]' -U --quiet #--user

Some properties calculated by ``deepchecks.nlp`` require additional packages to be installed. You can
install them by running:

.. code:: python

    import sys
    !{sys.executable} -m pip install 'deepchecks[nlp-properties]' -U --quiet #--user

Setting Up
==========

Load Data
---------
For the purpose of this guide, we'll use a small subset of the
`just dance <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/renatojmsantos/just-dance-on-youtube>`__ comment analysis dataset.
A dataset containing comments, metadata and labels for a multilabel category classification use case on youtube comments.

"""

from deepchecks.nlp import TextData
from deepchecks.nlp.datasets.classification import just_dance_comment_analysis

data = just_dance_comment_analysis.load_data(data_format='DataFrame',
                                             as_train_test=False)
metadata_cols = ['likes', 'dateComment']
data.head(2)

# %%
# Create TextData Objects
# ------------------------
#
# Deepchecks' :ref:`TextData <nlp__textdata_object>` object contains the text samples, labels, and possibly
# also properties and metadata. It stores
# cache to save time between repeated computations and contains functionalities for input validations and sampling.

label_cols = data.drop(columns=['originalText'] + metadata_cols)
class_names = label_cols.columns.to_list()
dataset = TextData(data['originalText'], label=label_cols.to_numpy().astype(int),
                   task_type='text_classification',
                   metadata=data[metadata_cols], categorical_metadata=[])

# %%
# Calculating Properties
# ----------------------
#
# Some of deepchecks' checks use properties of the text samples for various calculations. Deepcheck has a wide
# variety of such properties, some simple and some that rely on external models and are more heavy to run. In order
# for deepchecks' checks to be able to access the properties, they must be stored within the
# :ref:`TextData <nlp__textdata_object>` object. You can read more about properties in the
# :ref:`Property Guide <nlp__properties_guide>`.

# properties can be either calculated directly by Deepchecks
# or imported from other sources in appropriate format

# device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
# dataset.calculate_builtin_properties(include_long_calculation_properties=True, device=device)

properties = just_dance_comment_analysis.load_properties(as_train_test=False)
dataset.set_properties(properties, categorical_properties=['Language'])
dataset.properties.head(2)

# %%
# Running the deepchecks default suites
# =====================================
#
# Deepchecks comes with a set of pre-built suites that can be used to run a set of checks on your data, alongside
# with their default conditions and thresholds. You can read more about customizing and creating your own suites in the
# :ref:`Customizations Guide <general__customizations>`. In this guide we'll be using 3 suites - the data integrity
# suite, the train test validation suite and the model evaluation suite. You can also run all the checks at once using
# the :mod:`full_suite <deepchecks.nlp.suites>`.
#
# Data Integrity
# --------------
# We will start by doing preliminary integrity check to validate the text formatting. It is recommended to do this step
# before your train and test/validation splits and model training as it may imply additional data
# engineering is required.
#
# We'll do that using the :mod:`data_integrity <deepchecks.nlp.suites>` pre-built suite. Note that we are limiting
# the number of samples to 1000 in order to get quick high level overview of potential issues.

from deepchecks.nlp.suites import data_integrity

data_integrity_suite = data_integrity(n_samples=1000)
data_integrity_suite.run(dataset, model_classes=class_names)

# %%
# Integrity #1: Unknown Tokens
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# First up (in the “Didn’t Pass” tab) we see that the Unknown Tokens check
# has returned a problem.
#
# Looking at the result, we can see that it assumed (by default) that
# we’re going to use the bert-base-uncased tokenizer for our NLP model,
# and that if that’s the case there are many words in the dataset that
# contain characters (specifically here emojis) that are
# unrecognized by the tokenizer. This is an important insight, as bert
# tokenizers are very common.
#
# Integrity #2: Conflicting Labels
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Looking at the Conflicting Labels check result (in the “Didn’t Pass” tab) we can
# see that there are 2 occurrences of duplicate samples that have different labels.
# This may suggest a more severe labeling error in the dataset which we would want to explore further.
#

# %%
# Train Test Validation
# ---------------------
#
# The next suite, the :mod:`train_test_validation <deepchecks.nlp.suites>` suite serves to validate our split and
# compare the two dataset. These splits can be either you training and val / test sets, in which case you'd want to run
# this suite after the split was made but before training, or for example your training and inference data, in which
# case the suite is useful for validating that the inference data is similar enough to the training data.
#
# To run this suite we'll split the data into train and test/validation sets. We'll use a predefined split based
# on comment dates.

from deepchecks.nlp.suites import train_test_validation

train_ds, test_ds = just_dance_comment_analysis.load_data(
    data_format='TextData', as_train_test=True,
    include_embeddings=True, include_properties=True)
train_test_validation(n_samples=1000).run(train_ds, test_ds,
                                          model_classes=class_names)

# %%
# Train Test Validation #1: Properties Drift
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Based on the different properties we have calculated for the dataset, we can now search for
# properties whose distribution changes between the train and test datasets. Changes like this
# are especially important to look for when monitoring your model over time, as data drift
# is one of the top reasons why machine learning model’s performance degrades over time.
#
# In our case, we can see that the “% Special Characters”  and the "Formality" property have different distributions
# between train and test. Drilling further into the results, we can see that the language of the comments in the
# test set is much less formal and includes more special characters (possibly emojis?) than the train set.
# Since this change is quite significant, we may want to consider adding more informal comments containing
# special characters to the train set before training (or retraining) our model.
#
# Train Test Validation #2: Embedding Drift
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Similarly to the properties drift, we can also look for embedding drift between the train and test datasets.
# The benefit of using embedding on top of the properties is that they are able to detect semantic changes in the data.
#
# In our case, we see there are significant semantic differences between the train and test sets. Specifically,
# we can see some clusters that distinctly contain more samples from train or more samples from the train dataset or
# more sample from the test dataset. By hovering over the clusters we can read the user comments understand what is
# the difference between the clusters.

# %%
# Model Evaluation
# ----------------
#
# The suite below, the :mod:`model_evaluation <deepchecks.nlp.suites>` suite, is designed to be run after a model has
# been trained and requires model predictions which can be supplied via the relevant arguments in the ``run`` function.

train_preds, test_preds = just_dance_comment_analysis.\
    load_precalculated_predictions(pred_format='predictions',
                                   as_train_test=True)
train_probas, test_probas = just_dance_comment_analysis.\
    load_precalculated_predictions(pred_format='probabilities',
                                   as_train_test=True)

from deepchecks.nlp.suites import model_evaluation

suite = model_evaluation(n_samples=1000)
result = suite.run(train_ds, test_ds,
                   train_predictions=train_preds,
                   test_predictions=test_preds,
                   train_probabilities=train_probas,
                   test_probabilities=test_probas,
                   model_classes=class_names)
result.show()

# %%
# Model Eval #1: Train Test Performance
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# We can immediately see in the "Didn't Pass" tab that there has been significant degradation in the Recall on
# class “Pain and Discomfort”. Moreover, it seems there is a general deterioration in our model
# performance on the test set compared to the train set. This can be explained
# based on the data drift we saw in the previous suite.
#

# %%
# Running Individual Checks
# =========================
#
# Checks can also be run individually as well as within a suite. You can learn more about customizing suites,
# checks and conditions in our :ref:`Customizations Guide <general__customizations>`. In this section, we'll show you
# how to do that while showcasing one of our most interesting checks - :ref:`PropertySegmentPerformance
# <nlp__property_segments_performance>`.
#

from deepchecks.nlp.checks import PropertySegmentsPerformance

check = PropertySegmentsPerformance(segment_minimum_size_ratio=0.05)
check = check.add_condition_segments_relative_performance_greater_than(0.1)
result = check.run(test_ds, probabilities=test_probas)
result.show()

# %%
# In the display we can see some distinct property based segments that our model under performs on.
#
# By reviewing the results we can see that our model is performing poorly on samples that have a low level of
# Subjectivity, by looking at the "Subjectivity vs Average Sentence Length" tab
# We can see that the problem is even more severe on samples containing long sentences.
#
# In addition to the visual display, most checks also return detailed data describing the results. This data can be
# used for further analysis, create custom visualizations or to set custom conditions.
